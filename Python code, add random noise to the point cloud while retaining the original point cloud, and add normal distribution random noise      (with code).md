 Sometimes we need to expand the original point cloud data to make it more robust. 

 The idea is very simple, that is, to generate a random normal distribution of noise, and then add it to the original XYZ data of the point cloud; 

 Put the code directly, the code has been run, no problem: 

 The std in the code is the standard deviation of the normal distribution, which is the standard deviation of the distance distribution of the noise data from the original data

  ```  
 The last step is to combine the original data with the noisy data into one data.
