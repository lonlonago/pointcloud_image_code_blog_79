Scan Context is literally "scan, context" in English. Analogous to when we read, we need to understand the context in order to understand its meaning. When LidarSLAM performs loop detection, it also needs to compare the "context" (previous data) to know if we have come to the same place before (loop). 

 The main feature of the Scan Context paper, written by Giseop Kim and Ayoung Kim of KAIST University in South Korea, is to propose Scan Context, a global descriptor for non-histograms, to help us search for "context" (current/previous data) more quickly and efficiently. Typical applications are loop detection and Place Recognition in LiDAR SLAM.
